# Comparative parity harness

Two SDKs (`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` and `@openrouter/agent`) driven
through the SAME logical flow, transcripts captured from each, comparator
asserts behavioral equivalence. Two modes:

- **Emulated** — both SDKs hit an in-process scripted emulator. Deterministic.
  No API keys. Runs on every PR as a merge gate.
- **Live** — both SDKs hit real provider endpoints. Nondeterministic. Cost
  money. Runs on non-draft non-fork PRs as a yellow smoke check.

Plan doc: [`plans/comparative-parity-harness.md`](../../../plans/comparative-parity-harness.md).
Scenario authoring guide: [`scenarios/README.md`](scenarios/README.md).

## Local invocation

```bash
# Emulated suite (default; what CI runs as the merge gate)
npm run test:comparative

# Live smoke subset (requires real API keys)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... \
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-... \
  npm run test:comparative:live

# Single scenario (emulated)
npx vitest run \
  --config vitest.comparative.config.ts \
  -t "comparative scenario: 02-single-tool-call"
```

If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and/or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` are absent, the live
runner skips cleanly with a single `it.skip` — it does NOT silently fall back
to emulated mode. Fork PRs in CI hit this skip path because GitHub strips
secrets from `pull_request` runs on forked branches.

## CI invocation

Two workflows, both triggered on `pull_request` against `main`:

| Workflow                                              | Required?           | Triggers on forks? | Triggers on drafts? |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| `.github/workflows/comparative-parity-emulated.yml`   | YES (merge blocker) | YES                | YES                 |
| `.github/workflows/comparative-parity-live-smoke.yml` | NO (yellow only)    | NO (skipped)       | NO (skipped)        |

**The emulated workflow is the parity gate.** It runs the full canonical-16
scenario set; failure blocks merge. No secrets required — same emulator runs
on first-party and fork PRs.

**The live workflow is informational.** It runs the 4-scenario `liveSmoke`
subset against real provider endpoints, gated on the PR being non-draft and
non-fork (forks can't access repo secrets). The job posts a PR comment with
cost breakdown and per-scenario status. A failure here surfaces as yellow,
NOT red — live runs are inherently flaky and a flaky merge gate is worse
than no gate. Phase 6.8 will add auto-issue-open on persistent regression.

## Budget guardrails

Two layers, both enforced in live mode only (the emulator never charges):

### Per-scenario cap (in the harness)

Every scenario gets a `maxCostUsd` ceiling. Default $0.50; per-scenario
override via the JSON `maxCostUsd` field. The harness's `BudgetMonitor`
watches the SUM of `costUsd` across both SDKs and aborts both runs the
moment the sum exceeds the cap. On breach the return carries
`costBreach: true` — but the test does NOT fail. Budget breach is a
"refresh the scenario" signal (the canon scenario shouldn't normally cost
more than $0.50 to run against either SDK; if it does, the prompt or the
script grew unexpectedly).

### Per-PR aggregate cap (in the workflow)

The live workflow tallies `totalCostUsd` from the JSONL artifact
`tmp/comparative-live-cost-report.jsonl` after the test step exits and
warns (does NOT fail) if the aggregate exceeds $0.25/PR. With 4 smoke
scenarios at ~$0.05 each, the cap is mostly defense-in-depth against a
hot-loop regression — if a single scenario starts costing $1, both the
per-scenario cap AND the aggregate cap will surface it.

### Budget gotchas

- **The `costUsd` field on `OpenRouterAgentRun` is cumulative, not
  per-event.** The harness feeds the budget monitor the DELTA between
  consecutive observations so back-to-back `turn_end`/`session_end`
  events don't double-count.
- **The Anthropic SDK only reports `total_cost_usd` on the final
  `result` message.** Until that arrives, the Anthropic side's cost is
  zero in the budget — a runaway scenario won't trip the cap until the
  SDK terminates. The harness's `harnessTimeoutMs` is the backstop.
- **Emulated runs always report `costUsd: 0`.** The budget knob is a
  no-op in emulated mode; the field exists on the transcripts but the
  monitor never trips.

## Adding a new scenario

See [`scenarios/README.md`](scenarios/README.md) for the manual capture
workflow. The Phase 6.7-specific knobs you may want to set on the new
scenario JSON:

| Field              | Default | When to set                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `maxCostUsd`       | `0.5`   | Multi-turn / long-context flows known to exceed $0.50 across both SDKs in live mode.                                                                                                      |
| `harnessTimeoutMs` | `30000` | Failure-injection scenarios where the SDK's retry loop pushes past 30s. DO NOT widen the global default — keep narrow per-scenario overrides.                                             |
| `liveSmoke`        | `false` | Only set on scenarios that cover a meaningfully-distinct slice of the parity surface; the smoke set is intentionally small (3–4 scenarios) and must fit under the $0.25/PR aggregate cap. |
