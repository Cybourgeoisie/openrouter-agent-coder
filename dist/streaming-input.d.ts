 *
 * Named `UserInput` (NOT `UserMessage`) because `messages.ts` already exports
 * a `UserMessage` aggregator type (tool-result envelope from the rich message
 * stream). Keeping the names distinct avoids an index.ts re-export collision
 * and reflects the two concepts' different roles — `UserInput` is what the
 * host PUSHES INTO the agent, `UserMessage` (from `messages.ts`) is what the
 * agent EMITS as part of the assistant/user transcript.
 *
 * `content` accepts either a plain string or a lenient `ReadonlyArray<unknown>`
 * of OpenRouter content blocks (text / image / file / audio / video). The
 * library performs NO client-side validation on the array shape — OR's
 * Responses API does the Zod-level validation server-side, and replicating it
 * here would risk drift from OR's canonical schema. See the README parity
 * matrix's "Streaming input" row for the per-block reference.

 * queue FIRST (FIFO), then pulls the next value from the constructor-supplied
 * `AsyncIterable<UserInput>` (if any). End-of-input is signaled by `next()`
 * resolving with `{ done: true }`.
 *
 * Semantics:
 *
 * - When the constructor `prompt` is a `string`, the first `next()` yields a
 *   synthetic single-shot `UserInput` carrying that string; subsequent
 *   `next()` calls drain the imperative queue and end when it empties.
 * - When `prompt` is an `AsyncIterable<UserInput>`, the queue is checked
 *   first on each `next()`. If empty, the iterable's `next()` is awaited;
 *   when it returns `{ done: true }` and the queue is still empty on the
 *   next pull, the loop ends.
 * - Calling `push()` while a `next()` is already awaiting the iterable does
 *   NOT preempt the in-flight pull. The pushed value is buffered and
 *   delivered on the FOLLOWING `next()`. This keeps the iterable-driven
 *   contract predictable — the iterable is the primary clock when set.
 * - There is no upper bound on the queue length. Hosts pushing faster than
 *   the agent consumes will see the buffer grow unboundedly (the
 *   `pushUserMessage` API documents this so the host can implement its own
 *   back-pressure if needed).

 * Why commit:  When the SDK's `checkForInterruption` fires between turns, it
 * persists the in-flight assistant text under `partialResponse.text` but does
 * NOT append it to `ConversationState.messages`. The next `callModel` would
 * therefore lose that text from the conversation history — the model sees

 * was about to say". Committing the partial as an `assistant` message
 * preserves the Claude-SDK semantic ("partial assistant message committed")
 * and gives the next turn a faithful view of the conversation.
 *
 * What we don't commit:  `partialResponse.toolCalls` — these are tool
 * invocations that were in flight (and whose results never landed) when the
 * interrupt fired. Re-injecting them would leave the model waiting for tool
 * results that will never arrive. The simplest safe path is to drop them;
 * the next user message is appended after the assistant text only.
